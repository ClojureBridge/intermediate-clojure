# Contributing

## How to Contribute

Updates to the ClojureBridge curriculum are welcome and encouraged. We would not have anything without the input and guidance of the volunteers who put organize and attend ClojureBridge workshops.

Also, feel free to make forks of the curriculum and not contribute back. Make different curricula, too. these contribution guidelines are simply meant to provide guidance for the management of the main ClojureBridge curriculum.

## Getting Started

* Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free), if you don't have one, already.
* Fork the repository by navigating to the main [intermediate-clojure repository page](https://github.com/clojurebridge/intermediate-clojure), then clicking on the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner.

## Making Changes

TBD.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your committed changes to your local fork of the repository.
* Create a pull request (PR).
* Submit the pull request to the main ClojureBridge/intermediate-clojure repository.

The ClojureBridge intermediate-clojure curriculum team will review and discuss the pull request comments on the PR. Once two curriculum team members have given the PR a thumbs up, the PR will be accepted and merged!

## Curriculum Team

You may be asking, "Wait, why does the curriculum team get to say which PRs get accepted?"

I'm glad you asked!

If you contribute more than two patches to this repository, you too will become part of the curriculum team. Curriculum team members are given commit rights to the curriculum.

Note that commit rights are meant for approving PRs, not for making direct commits, and making direct commits may result in having your commit rights revoked.

### Discussion

There is also a [ClojureBridge curriculum Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurebridge-curriculum) for discussing curriculum direction.

## Workshop/Chapter Curriculum Forks

* Workshops or chapters that are using the main ClojureBridge curriculum should fork the curriculum in their chapter's GitHub, as seen [here](https://github.com/clojurebridge-sf/curriculum).
* Chapters should give teachers commit rights to their chapter's fork of the curriculum.
* Chapters are encouraged to contribute changes back to this main repository via PR!
